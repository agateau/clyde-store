This repository contains package definitions for [Clyde][], the prebuilt application package manager.

[Clyde]: https://github.com/agateau/clyde

## Branches

The `main` branch is the one used by default by Clyde. All package definitions in this branch must work with the currently released version of Clyde.

The `next` branch can be used for package definitions which use syntaxes not yet understood by the released version of Clyde. When a new version of Clyde is released, the `next` branch is merged in the `main` branch.
